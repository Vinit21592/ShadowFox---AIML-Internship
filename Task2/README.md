# Car-Price-Prediction

### Problem Statement:
The dataset contains information about the used cars.
The main aim is to predict the selling price of these used cars using Machine Learning techniques.

### Project Lifecycle:
The following approach explains the project lifecycle.

• Data Preprocessing : Exploring the data using pandas, numpy & identifying null values, missing values and outliers present in the dataset

• Data Visualization : Visualize the data through matplotlib, seaborn for finding insights of the variables present the dataset.

• Feature Engineering : Cleaning the data to select and transform the most relevant variables from raw data.

• Model Building : For model building Random Forest Regressor algorithm is used to predict the target variable.

• Tuning : Performed Hyperparameter tuning using randomizedSearchCV.

• Deployment : The project is deployed using Flask on Heroku.

### Technologies Used:
• Jupyter Notebook is used for IDE. 

• For creating webapp Flask framework is used.

• Front End is developed using HTML, CSS.

• Heroku is used for Model Deployment.
